# GermanOK
Python script which helps to learn German through vocabulary Database

The Database is for now a json:
{"German Word":["French Word", Number of Succes, Number of Fail], ...}

The user uses the Terminal to play.

There is 3 main playing functions:
- Play: The Script ask for German Word to be translated and register the number of failure and succes.
- Add: The user can add more words
- Remove: The user can remove words

There are a lot of improvements to be done:
- Acceptance of Upper and Lower case
- Create a user interface for UX
- Affect a probability of asked words in accordance with the number of failed and succes
- Use a DB like MySQL or MongoDB for data storing instead of a Json
