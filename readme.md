# GermanOK

GermanOK is a Python script that helps people to learn a foreign language.
The interface is purely in English and simple to use.

GermanOK is built like a little game that asks you to translate words. It store your score for each word to see your progression.
GermanOK allows you to add and remove words within the interface.

The interface is pretty small. The window can be opened on a corner of your screen and make a few games when bored.

## Idea

Make a interface which can stay opened on your screen without disturbing your work.
Sometimes you can play and guess a few words. You can also quickly add a new word that you hear right now!

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the needed libraries.

```bash
python -m pip install tkinter
python -m pip install json
python -m pip install time
```

Theses libraries should already be installed with python.
With an actual version, you should not need to install the above libraries.

## Usage

```python
cd /GermanOK
python3 run.py
```
